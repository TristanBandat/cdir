    Therefore string args will be possible.

    Inplement data structure as used in the C version.
+ Messure execution times of both versions under static circumstances.
    Show the results in the README but also this messurement 
    code should stay in the codebase as an additional printable information
    for 'verbose'(see below).
FEATURES:
+ Argument [Number]

    how many directories should be made.
    e.g. cdir test 10

    Displays folders which have the correct formatting.
    Show occurrences of folders and their numbering as well.
